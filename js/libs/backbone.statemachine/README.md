Backbone.StateMachine
=======================

Is a small javascript library to add state machine capacities to any *Backbone* or *non-Backbone* object.


Index
-------
    
- ``Backbone.StateMachine``. A module that can be mixed into any object, giving this object the super-powers of a state machine.
- ``Backbone.StatefulView``. A Backbone view, augmented with state machine capabilities. 


StateMachine
--------------

`Backbone.StateMachine` is used as a mixin, somewhat like `Backbone.Events`.


### Declaring a state machine ###########

Let's declare a very simple state machine representing an HTML element that can be either hidden or visible.

This machine will have 3 states, *init*, *hidden* and *visible*, and 3 transitions :

    init --['initialized']--> visible
    hidden  --['show']--> visible
    visible --['hide']--> hidden

Also, in order to actually show or hide the element, everytime the state machine enters in state *visible* a method *doShow* will be called, and everytime it leaves the state *visible*, a method *doHide* will be called.

```javascript

var element = {el: $('#myElement')}

// !!! note that `StateMachine` requires the `Events` mixin
_.extend(element, Backbone.StateMachine, Backbone.Events, {
  states: {
    visible: {enter: ['doShow'], leave: ['doHide']}, // All options see: 'state options'
    hidden: {}                                       // Declaring an emtpy state is optional
  },
  transitions: {
    init: {
      initialized: 'visible'            // You can declare a transition like that
    },
    visible: {
      hide: {
        enterState: 'hidden',           // Or like this if you want to specify options
        triggers: 'nowVisible'
      }
    },
    hidden: {
      show: {
        enterState: 'visible',
        triggers: 'nowHidden'
      }
    }
  },
  doShow: function() { this.el.show() },
  doHide: function() { this.el.hide() }
})
```

**state options**

- `enter` - array containing names of methods to call when entering the state _(Optional)_.
- `leave` - array containing names of methods to call when leaving the state _(Optional)_.

**transition options**

- `enterState` - arrival state of the transition.
- `callbacks` - array containing names of methods to call when transition is crossed _(Optional)_.
- `triggers` - Backbone event to trigger when transition is crossed _(Optional)_.

**Note** : _This is not demonstrated here, but you can also define a transition from one state to itself._


### Triggering transitions ###########

The state machines are always created in `init` state, even if it isn't declared. Therefore, you should always declare at least one transition from state `init` to another state.

```javascript

// !!! this method needs to be called before the state machine can be used
element.startStateMachine()

// First, let's get the machine out from 'init' state
element.trigger('initialized')

element.currentState                // 'visible'
element.trigger('hide')             // a transition is triggered, the element should disappear
element.currentState                // 'hidden'
element.trigger('hide')             // event 'hide' while in state 'hidden' -> no transition
element.trigger('show', 'quick')    // extra arguments will be passed to the callbacks
```


### Transition events ###########

Every time a transition is crossed, the state machine triggers a bunch of Backbone events. This way, you can setup an efficient event-based communication between the different parts of your application. Cool thing with using this method is that those different parts don't need to know each other.

```javascript

element.bind('transition', function(leaveState, enterState) {
  alert('Transition from state "'+leaveState+'" to state "'+enterState+'"')
})
element.bind('leaveState:hidden', function() {
  // synchronize other objects in your application
  bla.trigger('activate')
  aView.render()
})
element.bind('enterState:hidden', function() {
  // synchronize other objects in your application
  bla.trigger('deactivate')
})
```

Also, if your transition defines the `triggers` option, for example `{triggers: 'showItAll'}`, an extra event *'showItAll'* will be triggered when that transition is crossed :

```javascript

element.bind('showItAll', function() {
  // do stuff
})
```

If you want to hush-up the state machine, and prevent any of those events to be triggered, just set `silent` to `true` :

```javascript

element.silent = true      // next transitions will happen in silence
element.trigger('show')
element.trigger('hide')
element.silent = false     // next transitions will trigger events as described above
```


### Matching any state with '*' ###########

When declaring the transitions of your state machine, you can use the wildcard character `'*'` to match any state.

```javascript

var obj = {}
_.extend(obj, Backbone.StateMachine, Backbone.Events, {
  transitions: {
    visible: { hide: 'hidden' },
    hidden: { show: 'visible' },
    // No matter the machine's state, 'panic' will always trigger a transition :
    '*': { panic: 'panicking' }
  }
})
```


### Forcing the machine to a given state ###########

You can use the method `toState` to force the machine to a particular state. In that case, no transition will occur, but the `enter` callbacks will be executed.

```javascript
element.currentState       // 'hidden'
element.toState('visible') // the callback 'doShow' is executed.
element.currentState       // 'visible'
```


StatefulView
----------------

`Backbone.StatefulView` is a backbone view that has state machine capabilities, plus a few goodies.


### A css class for each state ################

To each state of the machine corresponds a css class on the view's `el`. By default the css class name is the state.

This makes styling very easy, for example :

```css

#myStatefulView.visible {
  display: block;
}
#myStatefulView.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```


### Transition events as view events ################

It is possible to declare transition events exactly the same way as in the `Backbone.View.events` hash. For example :

**Note** : _You don't need to call `startStateMachine` when using a `StatefulView`._

```javascript

var MyView = Backbone.StatefulView.extend({
  transitions: {
    'init': {'loaded': 'idle'}
    // transition will occur when clicking on '.activate'
    'idle': {'click .activate': 'active'}
  }
})
```


**state options**

- `className` - a css class added to view's `el` when the view is in this state.


Requirements
=============

``backbone.statemachine`` requires ``backbone`` (and therefore all its dependencies).

It is tested against backbone 0.9.2.


Questions, contributions ?
==============================

Any suggestion, comment, question - are welcome - contact me directly or open a ticket.

Any bug report, feature request, ... open a ticket !  To run tests, either open `tests/tests.html` in a browser, or run them from NodeJS (requires [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)):

```bash
npm install -g grunt
grunt
```
